      <!-- - All slots are the same (win jackpot - float) -->
      <!-- - if all slots are different (half of the jackpot) -->
      - If a given play results in two or more adjacent slots containing the same colour then the machine should pay out a prize of 5 times the cost of a single play.
      - If the machine does not have enought money to pay a prize it should credit the player with a number of free plays equal to the difference between the full prize and the amount of money available. This does not affect a jackpot win.
